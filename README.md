## Brief Elevator Pitch Describing Game

You own a drive-through potion shop and must fulfil customer orders by combining strange ingredients in a cauldron. However, ingredients have strange and wacky behaviors, different densities that cause them to rise to the top or sink to the bottom, and some ingredients even have catastrophic interactions that you must be careful to avoid or risk ruining your potion. Make a profit and pay off your 2000 gold loan by quickly and accurately serving your customers.
